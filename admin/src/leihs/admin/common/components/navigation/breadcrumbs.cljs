  - `:component-will-unmount`: Removes the 'popstate' event listener from the window object.

  - `:component-did-update`: Checks if a 'popstate' event has occurred and if the history has more than one entry. 
    If the URL of the second last entry in the history matches the URL of the next routing state, 
    it removes the last entry from the history. It then resets the 'popstate' atom to false.

  - `:reagent-render`: Checks if a new entry can be added to the history. If a reset is needed, 
    it resets the 'popstate' atom to false and the history to contain only the next routing state. 
    Otherwise, it updates the history with the next routing state.
